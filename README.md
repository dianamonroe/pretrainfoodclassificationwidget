## **Bread tagging and classification App** Flask app deployed using a temporary port url set up as public because of: 
  * A) Incompatibilities with Torch & Transformers libraries and Render that didn't allow to deploy the app using a permanent url 
  * B) High difficulty of setting up the Auth2 level process of Google Cloud Console to connect the Github Repository with the Drive Folders where the data is.
    * [Github Repository (/images folder ignored because it surpases github repo max storage with +20.000 images)](https://github.com/dianamonroe/pretrainfoodclassificationwidget)
    * CODESPACE NEEDS T BE ACTIVE FOR THE APP TO BE EXECTUED: [Temporary public bread classification and tagging app for chefs](https://5000-dianamonroe-pretrainfoo-2w8tlujr98p.ws-eu117.gitpod.io/)
